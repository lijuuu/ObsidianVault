     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

     COMMIT;
     ```

30. **Rollback transaction in case of an error**
     ```sql

     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;

     -- If an error occurs:
     ROLLBACK;
     ```
     
31. **Create an index for faster searches on the salary column**
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);
     ```
     
32. **Drop an index from the table**
     ```sql
     DROP INDEX idx_salary ON employees;
     ```
     
33. **Create a view for easy access to employee data**
     ```sql

     ```
     
35. **Update data through the view (if allowed)**
     ```sql
     UPDATE employee_view SET salary = salary + 5000 WHERE first_name = 'John';
     ```
     
36. **Drop the created view when no longer needed**
     ```sql
     DROP VIEW IF EXISTS employee_view;
     ```
     
37. **Use `ALTER` to add constraints on existing columns**  
      Example: Adding NOT NULL constraint.
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;
      ```
      
38. **Use `ALTER` to change default value of a column**  
      Example: Setting default for salary.
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN salary SET DEFAULT 50000;
      ```
      
39. **Set up cascading delete on foreign key**  
      Example: When deleting departments.
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
      ```
      
40. **Check the structure of the table**  
      Example: Describe command.
      ```sql
      DESCRIBE employees;
      ```
      
41. **Export data to CSV format**

      SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/employees.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' FROM employees;
      ```
      
42. **Import data from CSV format into the table**  
      Example: Importing employee data.
      ```sql
      LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/employees.csv' INTO TABLE employees FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
      ```
      
43. **Use `GRANT` to give permissions on the table**  
      Example: Granting select permission.
      ```sql
      GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user_role;
      ```
      
44. **Use `REVOKE` to remove permissions on the table**  
      Example: Revoking select permission.
      ```sql
      REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user_role;
      ```
      
45. **Create a trigger that logs changes made to the employee's salary**  
      Example: Trigger for logging updates.
      ```sql
      CREATE TRIGGER log_salary_change 
      AFTER UPDATE ON employees 
      FOR EACH ROW 
      BEGIN 
          INSERT INTO salary_log(employee_id, old_salary, new_salary) VALUES(OLD.employee_id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary);
      END;
      ```
      
46. **Drop a trigger when it's no longer needed**  
      Example: Dropping the trigger.
      ```sql
      DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS log_salary_change; 
      ```
      
47. **Create stored procedure to insert new employee**  
       Example: Stored procedure creation.
       ```sql
       CREATE PROCEDURE AddEmployee(IN emp_first_name VARCHAR(50), IN emp_last_name VARCHAR(50), IN emp_salary DECIMAL(10,2))
       BEGIN 
           INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary) VALUES (emp_first_name, emp_last_name, emp_salary); 
       END; 
       ```
       
48. **Call the stored procedure to add an employee**  
       Example: Calling stored procedure.
       ```sql 
       CALL AddEmployee('Sarah', 'Connor', 70000); 
       ```
       
49. **Use `SHOW TABLES` to list all tables in the database**  
       Example: Show all tables.
       ```sql 
       SHOW TABLES; 
       ```
       
50. **Use `SHOW COLUMNS` to describe columns in a specific table**
