Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide to SQL queries focusing on date and time usage, ranging from basic to advanced functions, using the current date of **Thursday, January 09, 2025, 7 PM IST** as a reference.

### Basic Date and Time Queries

1. **Retrieve Current Date and Time**
   ```sql
   SELECT NOW(); -- Returns current date and time
   ```

2. **Retrieve Current Date**
   ```sql
   SELECT CURDATE(); -- Returns current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   ```

3. **Retrieve Current Time**
   ```sql
   SELECT CURTIME(); -- Returns current time (HH:MI:SS)
   ```

4. **Extract Date from DateTime**
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE('2025-01-09 19:00:00') AS DatePart; -- Extracts date part
   ```

5. **Extract Time from DateTime**
   ```sql
   SELECT TIME('2025-01-09 19:00:00') AS TimePart; -- Extracts time part
   ```

### Intermediate Date and Time Functions

6. **Add Days to a Date**
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE_ADD('2025-01-09', INTERVAL 10 DAY) AS NewDate; -- Adds 10 days
   ```

7. **Subtract Days from a Date**
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE_SUB('2025-01-09', INTERVAL 5 DAY) AS NewDate; -- Subtracts 5 days
   ```

8. **Calculate Difference Between Two Dates**
   ```sql
   SELECT DATEDIFF('2025-01-19', '2025-01-09') AS DaysDifference; -- Returns number of days between two dates
   ```

9. **Extract Specific Parts of a Date**
   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2025-01-09') AS YearPart; -- Extracts year
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM '2025-01-09') AS MonthPart; -- Extracts month
   SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM '2025-01-09') AS DayPart; -- Extracts day
   ```

10. **Find Rows Between Two Dates**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'; -- Finds events in January 2025
    ```

### Advanced Date and Time Queries

11. **Find Rows Created Within the Last Week**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date > (CURDATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY); -- Events from the last week
    ```

12. **Find Events Scheduled for a Specific Time Range**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM events 
    WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2025-01-09 19:00:00' AND '2025-01-09 23:59:59'; -- Events on January 9, 2025, after 7 PM
    ```

13. **Get the First Day of the Month**
    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW() ,'%Y-%m-01') AS FirstDayOfMonth; -- Returns the first day of the current month
    ```

14. **Get the Last Day of the Month**
    ```sql
    SELECT LAST_DAY(NOW()) AS LastDayOfMonth; -- Returns the last day of the current month
    ```

15. **Get Weekday Name from a Date**
    ```sql
    SELECT DAYNAME('2025-01-09') AS WeekdayName; -- Returns the name of the weekday (e.g., Thursday)
    ```

16. **Get Week Number of the Year**
    ```sql
    SELECT WEEK('2025-01-09') AS WeekNumber; -- Returns week number for the given date
    ```

17. **Get Quarter of the Year**
    ```sql
    SELECT QUARTER('2025-01-09') AS QuarterNumber; -- Returns quarter number (1 to 4)
    ```

18. **Convert UTC to Local Time (if applicable)**
    ```sql
    SELECT CONVERT_TZ(NOW(), '+00:00', '+05:30') AS LocalTime; -- Converts UTC to IST (UTC+5:30)
    ```

### Formatting Dates

19. **Format Date Output**
    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT('2025-01-09', '%W, %M %d, %Y') AS FormattedDate; -- Outputs formatted date (e.g., Thursday, January 09, 2025)
    ```

20. **Custom Time Formatting**
    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%H:%i:%s') AS FormattedTime; -- Outputs time in HH:MM:SS format
    ```

### Miscellaneous Functions

21. **Check if a Date is Valid**
    ```sql
    SELECT STR_TO_DATE('2025-02-30', '%Y-%m-%d') IS NOT NULL AS IsValidDate; -- Checks if date is valid (returns FALSE)
    ```

22. **Get Current Timestamp in UTC**
    ```sql
    SELECT UTC_TIMESTAMP(); -- Returns current UTC timestamp 
    ```

23. **Find Age Based on Birthdate**
    ```sql
    SELECT FLOOR(DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), '1990-05-15') / 365) AS Age; -- Calculates age based on birthdate 
    ```

24. **Calculate Future or Past Dates Using INTERVAL**
    ```sql
    SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL 1 MONTH AS FutureDate; -- Adds one month to current date and time 
    ```

25. **Using CASE with Dates for Conditional Logic**
    ```sql
    SELECT CASE 
        WHEN event_date < CURDATE() THEN 'Past Event'
        WHEN event_date = CURDATE() THEN 'Today'
        ELSE 'Future Event'
        END AS EventStatus 
      FROM events;
    ```
