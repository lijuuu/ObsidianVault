- Big Thanks to Mariya Mam and Sivasakthi Sir, they really helped us a lot in terms of communication and boosted our confidence as well.
- Before the boarding classes, we were taught various communication techniques, but we weren't able to apply them effectively.
- During the boarding week, we were not only able to understand how to apply what we learned, but also gained clarity about our own personality and areas of improvement.
- The sessions were interactive and engaging, which made it easier to come out of our comfort zone and express ourselves freely.
- We learned how to carry ourselves professionally, present ideas clearly, and actively listen in a conversation.
- It wasn't just about improving English or speaking fluently, it was about becoming more self-aware and confident in both formal and informal settings.
- The boarding week gave us a safe space to make mistakes, learn, and grow without judgment.
- Overall, it has been a great experience and we now feel more prepared to face real-world communication challenges in the workplace.
